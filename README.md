# Profile Context
This profile is an example profile to test the capabilities of train-pwsh and inspec-pwsh. The controls in this profile are a subset of the Microsoft 365 profile, and most details below explain the CIS Benchmarks the latter profile. 

Please refer to the documentation for [train-pwsh](https://github.com/mitre/train-pwsh) and [inspec-pwsh](https://github.com/mitre/inspec-pwsh) for details on how to use those tools. 
## Control Descriptions

Controls 1.1.3 and 1.2.1 are examples of Microsoft Graph module in use. This uses the graph/exchange pwsh session from the pwsh_single_session_executor resource.
Control 1.3.6 is an example of Microsoft ExchangeOnline module in use. This uses the graph/exchange pwsh session from the pwsh_single_session_executor resource. 
Control 7.2.3 is an example of Microsoft Powershell.PnP module in use. This uses the teams/pnp pwsh session from the pwsh_single_session_executor resource. 
Control 8.5.3 is an example of Microsoft Teams module in use. This uses the teams/pnp pwsh session from the pwsh_single_session_executor resource. 
Control 8.6.1 is an example of Microsoft Teams module in use. This uses the exchange and teams pwsh session from the pwsh_exchange_executor and pwsh_teams_executor resources respectively. 

This example profile mainly a custom resource named pwsh_single_session_executor. Within it, there are two functions named run_script_in_graph_exchange and run_script_in_teams_pnp. The names of these methods imply which modules in powershell they connect to. The goal of these methods is to establish one session for commands that connect to graph/exchange and one session for commands that connect to teams/pnp. The result of this will allow the microsoft profile to run its controls much more quickly.

Control 8.6.1 in particular is an example of using two separate resources, one to run exchange commands and the other to run teams commands.

# CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark
This InSpec Profile was created to facilitate testing and auditing of `CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark`
infrastructure and applications when validating compliancy with [Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmark](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
requirements.
 
- Profile Version: **3.0.0**
- Benchmark Date: **2024-04-29**
- Benchmark Version: **3.1.0**
 
 
This profile was developed to reduce the time it takes to perform a security checks based upon the
CIS Guidance from the Center for Internet Security (CIS).
 
The results of a profile run will provide information needed to support an Authority to Operate (ATO)
decision for the applicable technology.
 
The CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark CIS Profile uses the [InSpec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec)
open-source compliance validation language to support automation of the required compliance, security
and policy testing for Assessment and Authorization (A&A) and Authority to Operate (ATO) decisions
and Continuous Authority to Operate (cATO) processes.

## Benchmark Information
The Center for Internet Security, Inc. (CISÂ®) create and maintain a set of Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls) for applications, computer systems and networks
connected to the Department of Defense (DoD). These guidelines are the primary security standards
used by the DoD agencies. In addition to defining security guidelines, the CISs also stipulate
how security training should proceed and when security checks should occur. Organizations must
stay compliant with these guidelines or they risk having their access to the DoD terminated.
 
Requirements associated with the CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark are derived from the
[Security Requirements Guides](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/security_requirements_guide)
and align to the [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST)
[Special Publication (SP) 800-53](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/sp800-53-controls/release-search#!/800-53)
Security Controls, [DoD Control Correlation Identifier](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/cci/) and related standards.
 
The CIS Microsoft 365 Foundations Benchmark profile checks were developed to provide technical implementation
validation to the defined DoD requirements, the guidance can provide insight for any organizations wishing
to enhance their security posture and can be tailored easily for use in your organization.

## Getting Started  
### InSpec (CINC-auditor) setup
For maximum flexibility/accessibility `cinc-auditor`, the open-source packaged binary version of Chef InSpec should be used,
compiled by the CINC (CINC Is Not Chef) project in coordination with Chef using Chef's always-open-source InSpec source code.
For more information see [CINC Home](https://cinc.sh/)
 
It is intended and recommended that CINC-auditor and this profile executed from a __"runner"__ host
(such as a DevOps orchestration server, an administrative management system, or a developer's workstation/laptop)
against the target. This can be any Unix/Linux/MacOS or Windows runner host, with access to the Internet.
 
> [!TIP]
> **For the best security of the runner, always install on the runner the latest version of CINC-auditor and any other supporting language components.**
 
To install CINC-auditor on a UNIX/Linux/MacOS platform use the following command:
```bash
curl -L https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -P cinc-auditor
```
 
To install CINC-auditor on a Windows platform (Powershell) use the following command:
```powershell
. { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.cinc.sh/install.ps1 } | iex; install -project cinc-auditor
```
 
To confirm successful install of cinc-auditor:
```
cinc-auditor -v
```
 
Latest versions and other installation options are available at [CINC Auditor](https://cinc.sh/start/auditor/) site.
 
[top](#table-of-contents)
### Intended Usage
1. The latest `released` version of the profile is intended for use in A&A testing, as well as
    providing formal results to Authorizing Officials and Identity and Access Management (IAM)s.
    Please use the `released` versions of the profile in these types of workflows.
 
2. The `main` branch is a development branch that will become the next release of the profile.
    The `main` branch is intended for use in _developing and testing_ merge requests for the next
    release of the profile, and _is not intended_ be used for formal and ongoing testing on systems.
 
[top](#table-of-contents)
### Tailoring to Your Environment
This profile uses InSpec Inputs to provide flexibility during testing. Inputs allow for
customizing the behavior of Chef InSpec profiles.
 
InSpec Inputs are defined in the `inspec.yml` file. The `inputs` configured in this
file are **profile definitions and defaults for the profile** extracted from the profile
guidances and contain metadata that describe the profile, and shouldn't be modified.
 
InSpec provides several methods for customizing profile behaviors at run-time that does not require
modifying the `inspec.yml` file itself (see [Using Customized Inputs](#using-customized-inputs)).
 
The following inputs are permitted to be configured in an inputs `.yml` file (often named inputs.yml)
for the profile to run correctly on a specific environment, while still complying with the security
guidance document intent. This is important to prevent confusion when test results are passed downstream
to different stakeholders under the *security guidance name used by this profile repository*
 
For changes beyond the inputs cited in this section, users can create an *organizationally-named overlay repository*.
For more information on developing overlays, reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre-saf-training.netlify.app/courses/beginner/10.html)

> [!NOTE]
>Inputs are variables that are referenced by control(s) in the profile that implement them.
 They are declared (defined) and given a default value in the `inspec.yml` file.
 
#### Using Customized Inputs
Customized inputs may be used at the CLI by providing an input file or a flag at execution time.
 
1. Using the `--input` flag
 
    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input disable_slow_controls=true`
 
2. Using the `--input-file` flag.
   
    Example: `[inspec or cinc-auditor] exec <my-profile.tar.gz> --input-file=<my_inputs_file.yml>`
 
>[!TIP]
> For additional information about `input` file examples reference the [MITRE SAF Training](https://mitre.github.io/saf-training/courses/beginner/06.html#input-file-example)

### Testing the Profile Controls
The Gemfile provided contains all the necessary ruby dependencies for checking the profile controls.
#### Requirements
All action are conducted using `ruby` (gemstone/programming language). Currently `inspec`
commands have been tested with ruby version 3.1.2. A higher version of ruby is not guaranteed to
provide the expected results. Any modern distribution of Ruby comes with Bundler preinstalled by default.
 
Install ruby based on the OS being used, see [Installing Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
 
After installing `ruby` install the necessary dependencies by invoking the bundler command
(must be in the same directory where the Gemfile is located):
```bash
bundle install
```
 
#### Testing Commands
 
Linting and validating controls:
```bash
  bundle exec rake [inspec or cinc-auditor]:check # Validate the InSpec Profile
  bundle exec rake lint                            # Run RuboCop Linter
  bundle exec rake lint:auto_correct       # Autocorrect RuboCop offenses (only when it's safe)
  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks  # Pre-commit checks
```
 
Ensure the controls are ready to be committed into the repo:
```bash
  bundle exec rake pre_commit_checks
```

## Running the Profile
### Directly from Github
This option is best used when network connectivity is available and policies permit
access to the hosting repository.
 
```bash
# Using `pwsh` transport
time bundle exec inspec exec . -t pwsh://pwsh-options --input-file=inputs.yml
```

## Using Heimdall for Viewing Test Results
The JSON results output file can be loaded into **[Heimdall-Lite](https://heimdall-lite.mitre.org/)**
or **[Heimdall-Server](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2)** for a user-interactive, graphical view of the profile scan results.
 
Heimdall-Lite is a `browser only` viewer that allows you to easily view your results directly and locally rendered in your browser.
Heimdall-Server is configured with a `data-services backend` allowing for data persistency to a database (PostgreSQL).
For more detail on feature capabilities see [Heimdall Features](https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2?tab=readme-ov-file#features)
 
Heimdall can **_export your results into a DISA Checklist (CKL) file_** for easily uploading into eMass using the `Heimdall Export` function.
 
Depending on your environment restrictions, the [SAF CLI](https://saf-cli.mitre.org) can be used to run a local docker instance
of Heimdall-Lite via the `saf view:heimdall` command.
 
Additionally both Heimdall applications can be deployed via docker, kubernetes, or the installation packages.
